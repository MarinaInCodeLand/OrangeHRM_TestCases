# OrangeHRM Test Cases (HTML/CSS)

This repository contains **manual test cases** for the OrangeHRM demo web application, currently implemented using **HTML and CSS**.

## About

I personally created the **HTML structure and styling** for these test cases. The project is still **a work in progress** and the main goal is to eventually **implement it in React** with additional features such as a **breadcrumb navigation** and improved interactivity.

The test cases currently include steps, expected results, and layout for easy viewing and reference. This project serves as a practice for **frontend development and QA documentation**.

## Features (Planned)

- Convert the current HTML/CSS structure into a React application  
- Add breadcrumb navigation for better usability  
- Make test cases interactive (expand/collapse, filters, etc.)  
- Enhance styling and responsive design
